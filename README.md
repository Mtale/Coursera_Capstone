# Applied Data Science Capstone
https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone

This repository contains several notebooks used on Applied Data Science Capstone course on Coursera. 
The capstone project notebook *name to be defined* requires the Python package in this repo to work as most of the code are run under the hood to keep notebook easy to approach.

The package is designed for this particular project and any use outside of the current scope is discouraged due to lack of testing for any other scenarios.
However, I hope you will find inspiration while trying it out!
